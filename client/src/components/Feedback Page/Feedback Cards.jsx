                Poverty is not having enough material possessions or income for
                a person's basic needs.[2] Poverty may include social, economic,
                and political elements.[3] Absolute poverty is the complete lack
                of the means necessary to meet basic personal needs, such as
                food, clothing, and shelter.[4] The floor at which absolute
                poverty is defined is always about the same, independent of the
                person's permanent location or era. On the other hand, relative
                poverty occurs when a person cannot meet a minimum level of
                living standards, compared to others in the same time and place.
                Therefore, the floor at which relative poverty is defined varies
                from one country to another, or from one society to another.
